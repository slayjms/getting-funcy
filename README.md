## **Getting Funcy**

### **Setup**

1. Open your terminal on your computer.
2. If you haven't already, install the Mocha testing suite using npm install -g mocha.
3. Run a command `npm test` in your terminal to initiate the testing process.

### **Workflow**

You'll be primarily working in a file named `main.test.js`. Follow the instructions outlined in the Tasks section below to create and utilize global variables and functions. Pay attention to the feedback provided in the terminal to guide your progress!

### **Guidelines**

- Functions act as specialized tools that can perform specific tasks or calculations.
- Avoid directly modifying variable values; instead, utilize functions to manipulate them.

### **Tasks**

Let's begin by setting up some numerical variables that we'll use for calculations.

#### **Variables**

- Create a global variable named `a` and assign it a number value of your choice.
- Define another global variable named `b` and assign it a different value.
- Establish a global variable named `c` and set it initially to `0`.
- Define a global variable named `name`and set it equal to a string of your first name.
- Define a global variable named `lastName`and set it equal to a string of your last name.
- Define a global variable named `trafficLight` and set it equal to 'red'.


Now, let's develop some functions to perform mathematical operations with these variables!

#### **Functions**

- Write a function named `addition` to add the values of `a` and `b`, storing the result in `c`.
- Write a function called `subtraction` to subtract the value of `b` from `a`, storing the result in `c`.
- Write a function named `multiplication` to multiply the values of `a` and `b`, storing the result in `c`.
- Write a function named `division` to divide the value of `a` by `b`, storing the result in `c`.
- Write a function named `incrementA` to increase the value of `a` by `1`.
- Write a function called `decrementB` to decrease the value of `b` by `1`.
- Write a function called `fullName` that sets the variable `name` with a space and the variable `lastName` together.
- Write a function called `lightChange` that sets the variable `trafficLight` equal to 'green'.
